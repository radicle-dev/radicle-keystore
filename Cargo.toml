[features]
default = []
# The test feature exists to allow this crate to be configured equivalently to
# `#[cfg(test)]`, as `#[cfg(test)]` doesn't propagate to dependencies. We use
# this to employ weaker scrypt params for testing purposes.
#
# Using this exploits that cargo will shadow a dependency appearing in
# `[dependencies]` with the one of the same name appearing in
# `[dev-dependencies`]. So, to make the tests in `mycrate` (which uses
# `radicle-keystore`) go faster, add `radicle-keystore` in **both**
# [`dependencies`] and [`dev-dependencies`], where the latter one is configured
# with `features = ["test"]`.
